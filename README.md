# LinearRegression

This example project demonstrates how the gradient descent algorithm may be used to solve a linear regression problem.

This code demonstrates how a gradient descent search may be used to solve the linear regression problem of fitting a line to a set of points. In this problem, we wish to model a set of points using a line. The line model is defined by two parameters - the line's slope `m`, and y-intercept `b`. Gradient descent attemps to find the best values for these parameters, subject to an error function.

The `main` defines a set of parameters used in the gradient descent algorithm including an initial guess of the line slope and y-intercept, the learning rate to use, and the number of iterations to run gradient descent for. 

```python
initial_b = 0 # initial y-intercept guess
initial_m = 0 # initial slope guess
num_iterations = 1000
``` 

Using these parameters a gradient descent search is executed on a sample data set.
